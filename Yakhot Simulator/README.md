======================================================

Version 3.0

Follow along the options

The simulation can be executed from a file or you can choose to create
a new Truss.

Besides being a very accurate load simulator to evaluate Trusses' designs,
it has great extra features:

	1. Colormorphism
	2. Truss Plotting 
	3. Minimalist enviorment
	4. Works for any design, no matter how big or small
	5. Incredible accuracy 
	6. Graph simulation on load increments of 0.05

The Truss will be plot for you along with the X and Y coordinates and
the loads.

In order to create a new Truss, you will be asked to enter:

	1. The number of members
	2. The number of joints
	3. The X and Y positions of every joint
	4. The joint in which the load is applied

Notes: This simulator is for Trusses that are pined down on one side
and are supported by a roller on the right side. Additinally, you have
to make sure that you label the first joint as the one on the left
side, pined to the ground and the last one, as the one on the right
side supported by the roller.
